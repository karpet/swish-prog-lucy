   of Lucy FullTextField objects.
 - add find_relevant_fields feature to locate the fields that matched the
   query. Depends upon highlightable_fields being set to true.

0.03 28 June 2011
 - no functional changes, just bumped version because SWISH::Prog 0.51 had
   not been released prior to 0.02 and all the failing test reports are
   misleading.
