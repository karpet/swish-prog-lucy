    aggregator => 'fs',
    indexer    => 'lucy',
    config     => 'path/to/swish.conf',
 );
 
 $indexer->index('path/to/files');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<STOP>: Read the L<SWISH::Prog> documentation before you use this
module.

SWISH::Prog::Lucy is an Apache Lucy based implementation of Swish3,
using the SWISH::3 bindings for libswish3.

See the L<SWISH::Prog> docs for more information about the class
hierarchy and history.

See the Swish3 development site at L<http://dev.swish-e.org/wiki/swish3>.

=head1 Why Not Use Lucy Directly?

You can use Lucy directly. Using Lucy via SWISH::Prog::Lucy
offers a few advantages:

=over

=item Aggregators and Filters

You get to use all of SWISH::Prog's Aggregators and SWISH::Filter support.
So you can easily index all kinds of file formats 
(email, .txt, .html, .xml, .pdf, .doc, .xls, etc) 
without writing your own parser.

=item SWISH::3

SWISH::3 offers fast and robust XML and HTML parsers 
with an extensible configuration system, build on top of libxml2.

=item Simple now, complex later

You can index your content with SWISH::Prog::Lucy,
then build a more complex searching application directly
with Lucy.
